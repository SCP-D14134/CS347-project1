            The client I chose is my brother. What he wants is a web page that can remind him of class and homework. To
            satisfy him, I made page Course and page To Do. On this basis, I also wrote page Home, page Anniversary, and
            page Wish List.
        </p>

        <p>
            My website has index.html and five other separate pages, and they all have a meaningful purpose. Each of my
            websites has a title, and there is a menu link to them.
        </p>

        <p>
            All my text content is original. I got the wallpaper and menu symbols from other websites. I use three
            folders css, js, and image to organize files. I do not use any third-party software, such as React.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used six different fonts on the website. My website supports large screens of general equipment, but it is
            not well adapted to small screens. Every page on the website can pass Nu Validator's inspection.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My website has a link to an external website, and that is the wallpaper I collected from that website. My
            menu is interactive, and users can control it to move left and right through buttons.
        </p>

        <p>
            My source code is on my github, and that repository is public. The file name of each file contains only
            lowercase English letters and the symbol "-". My website has my own domain name, which is project1.rentx.me.
            Users can access my website via HTTP, either 80 or 443 will do.
